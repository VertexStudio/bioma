# Bioma: A Multi-Agent Cognition Engine

Bioma is a powerful and flexible framework for building intelligent multi-agent systems. It combines the strengths of behavior trees, utility AI, and large language models (LLMs) to create agents capable of complex decision-making and goal-directed behaviors.

## Key Features

- **Behavior Trees**: Bioma utilizes behavior trees as the core structure for defining agent behaviors. Behavior trees provide a modular and hierarchical approach to designing and executing complex agent actions and decision-making processes.

- **Utility AI**: Bioma incorporates utility AI techniques to enable agents to dynamically prioritize and select behaviors based on their current goals, preferences, and environmental factors. This allows for more adaptive and contextually relevant agent behaviors.

- **LLM Integration**: Bioma leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to enhance agent cognition and decision-making capabilities. LLMs can be used for tasks such as natural language understanding, knowledge retrieval, and generating meaningful responses or actions.

- **Generative and Vision Models**: Bioma integrates generative models and vision models as tools to further expand the capabilities of agents. Generative models can be used for creating new content or solutions, while vision models enable agents to perceive and analyze visual information from their environment.

- **Multi-Agent Support**: Bioma is designed to support multi-agent systems, allowing for the creation and coordination of multiple intelligent agents within a single environment. Agents can communicate, collaborate, and interact with each other to achieve common goals or compete against each other.

- **Extensible Architecture**: Bioma provides an extensible architecture that allows developers to easily integrate new models, behaviors, and capabilities into their agents. The modular design of behavior trees and the flexibility of utility AI enable seamless integration of additional components and features.

## Getting Started

To get started with Bioma, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Bioma repository: `git clone https://github.com/BiomaAI/bioma.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `cargo install`
3. Explore the examples and documentation to understand the basic concepts and usage of Bioma.
4. Start building your own intelligent agents using the provided APIs and tools.

## Examples

Bioma comes with a set of example agents and scenarios to demonstrate its capabilities. Some notable examples include:

- **ChatBot**: A conversational agent that utilizes LLMs to engage in natural language conversations and provide helpful responses.
- **Autonomous Explorer**: An agent that navigates and explores a virtual environment, making decisions based on its perception and goals.
- **Collaborative Planners**: Multiple agents working together to plan and execute complex tasks by combining their individual capabilities and knowledge.

## Cognition server example

[Agentic RAG Server](tools/rag_server/docs/rag_server.md)

### Launch the server:

```bash
# Launch with default configuration
cargo run --release -p cognition --bin cognition-server

# Launch with custom tools configuration
cargo run --release -p cognition --bin cognition-server assets/configs/rag_tools_config_server.json
```

### Launch cognition-client

```bash
# Launch with default configuration. First argument is requiered and is the prefix for the tools actors.
cargo run --release -p cognition --bin cognition-client /rag/client

# Launch with custom configuration
cargo run -p cognition --bin cognition-client /rag/client assets/configs/rag_tools_config_server.json
```

### Swagger-ui documentation

API documentation is provided in the dashboard. The `congition` server should be up to be able to visualize it.

If you only want to visualize the documentation outside the dashboard, from the broswer, navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5766/docs/swagger-ui/dist/index.html
```

### Generate TypeScript API Client

You can generate a TypeScript API client using the OpenAPI Generator CLI:

```bash
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
    -i http://localhost:5766/api-docs/openapi.json \
    -g typescript-axios \
    -o ./generated-api
```

This will generate a TypeScript client based on the OpenAPI specification, using Axios as the HTTP client.
